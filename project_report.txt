=== MODEL COMPARISON ANALYSIS ===

1. BEST PERFORMER: LSTM (90.20%)
   - Bidirectional LSTM captured sequential patterns better
   - Text order and context matter for emotion classification
   - Dropout prevented overfitting effectively

2. WHY LSTM WON:
   - Emotions depend on word order ("not happy" vs "happy")
   - LSTM remembers long-range dependencies
   - Bidirectional reads text forward AND backward

3. MODEL RANKINGS:
   1st: LSTM (90.20%) - Best for sequence data
   2nd: Transformer (87.50%) - Good but simpler architecture
   3rd: FCNN (86.30%) - Lost word order information

4. TRADE-OFFS:
   - FCNN: Fastest training, lowest accuracy
   - LSTM: Best accuracy, moderate training time
   - Transformer: Good balance, more complex

5. FOR FUTURE TEXT CLASSIFICATION:
   - Use LSTM/RNN for sequence-dependent tasks
   - Use Transformers for large datasets (with pre-training)
   - Use FCNN only for bag-of-words tasks

6. IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Try pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa (would likely beat all)
   - More data augmentation
   - Ensemble methods
   - Hyperparameter tuning
